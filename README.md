WEBB STORE


https://tinasshop.netlify.app

This i an online store that fetches its products from an existing external API (Fake Store API) and renders them on the website. 
It is possible to place orders from the website, 
which are then stored in Google Firebase and managed with CRUD functionality from the web interface.
