WEBB STORE


https://tinasshop.netlify.app

This is an initial project developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
It represents an online store that retrieves its product data from an external API (Fake Store API) and displays it on the website. 
Users can make purchases through the website, and these transactions are stored in Google Firebase, which is managed using CRUD functionality accessible via the web interface.
